    "**`Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)` helps language models access up-to-date or domain-specific information by combining retrieval with generation. Instead of relying only on what the model was trained on, RAG first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and then uses those to generate more accurate and grounded responses. This makes it especially useful for tasks where correctness and context matter.**"

    "**RAG Response**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pay rent on a weekly basis, you must give your landlord **at least 28 days' notice** to vacate the unit. The termination date must be the end of a weekly rental period. This notice period applies specifically to weekly tenancies.\n",

    "**non-RAG Response**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notice period will depend on the terms of your rental agreement with your landlord. In most cases, landlords require tenants to give 30 days' notice before vacating the unit. However, some landlords may require longer notice periods, **such as 60 or 90 days**. It is important to review your rental agreement or speak with your landlord to determine the specific notice period required in your situation.\n"

The specific hours during which a landlord can enter a tenant's home may vary depending on local landlord-tenant laws or the terms outlined in the rental agreement. However, the following general guidelines are commonly observed:\\n\\n1. **Standard Hours**: Landlords are usually permitted to enter a rental unit between reasonable hours, typically defined as between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. This timeframe is considered reasonable and respects the tenant's right to privacy and peaceful enjoyment of their home.\\n\\n2. **24-Hour Notice**: Landlords are typically required to provide tenants with advance notice before entering the rental unit, usually at least 24 hours in advance. The notice should specify the date and time of entry, allowing tenants to prepare for the landlord's visit.\\n\\n3. **Emergency Exceptions**: In cases of emergencies that require immediate attention to prevent damage to the property or address safety concerns, landlords may be allowed to enter the rental unit outside of the standard hours without providing prior notice to the tenant.\\n\\n4. **Tenant's Consent**: If a tenant agrees to let the landlord enter the rental unit at a specific time outside of the standard hours, the landlord may do so with the tenant's consent. In such cases, it is advisable to have the agreement documented in writing to avoid any misunderstandings.\\n\\nIt is important for landlords to adhere to the specified hours for entry outlined in the applicable laws or rental agreement and to respect the tenant's right to privacy and quiet enjoyment of their home. Tenants should familiarize themselves with their rights regarding landlord entry and review their rental agreement to understand the conditions under which landlords are permitted to enter the rental unit. Effective communication and mutual respect between landlords and tenants can help maintain a positive landlord-tenant relationship.\""
